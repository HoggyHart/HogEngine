# HogEngine
My crummy little game engine/game that I have a vague, undefined, all-in-my-head, plan for.

Started from the tutorial found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44tO977slsU , specifically at some point he made some changes to the program that weren't detailed in the videos so I downloaded the github ver of the project and worked from there which explains why mine is also called BirchEngine. I did not just mindlessly copy every single action click=by-click.
